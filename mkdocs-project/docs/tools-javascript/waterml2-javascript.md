# Learn WaterML 2 / Tools for JavaScript

This page provides information about using WaterML format with JavaScript.

No object-oriented JavaScript APIs for WaterML 2 have been identified.
Instead, organizations tend to use XML Document Object Model (DOM) parsing tools to select needed data elements from WaterML 2 content.
In other cases, alternative formats to WaterML 2 are used to retrieve time series data in order to simplify data parsing.

JavaScript tools will be added as they are discovered and tested.
